# Task 4 â€“ Airdrop Participation

## Theory  
Airdrops are promotional mechanisms in crypto where projects distribute free tokens to early users. They help bootstrap communities, reward engagement, and spread awareness of new projects.

## What I Did  
- Signed up on a platform offering an airdrop (e.g. PublicAI or other).  
- Connected my wallet or completed onboarding steps.  
- Explored the dashboard and completed simple tasks to earn points.  
- Documented my experience for learning and future reference.  

## Learnings & Reflection  
- I now understand how airdrops help projects gain early users.  
- I saw how wallet onboarding and reward systems work.  
- This practical experience demystified token distribution and Web3 incentives.
